# Customer satisfaction drivers with survey data

The aim of this notebook is to provide an example on how to help a potential client (a hotel chain) to know how they can maximize the overall satisfaction of 
their clients. For this purpose, we have data from conducted surveys. Solving this problem is equivalent to knowing which are the main drivers of overall customer 
satisfaction, in other words, what **causes** customer satisfaction. This would need a properly design experiment to reach good conclusions, but for the sake of
learning  this time we are going to extract causal relationships from observational data (ie. where the independents variables are not under the control of the 
researcher).

The repo includes the following files:

* CSV data
* EDA as pandas-profiling reports HTML files
* requirements.txt file
* Detailed jupyter notebook
* HTML version of the notebook

Please refer to [the notebook](https://github.com/alvfermar/customer_satisfaction/blob/master/customer_satisfaction.ipynb) for a detailed explanation of the analysis.
